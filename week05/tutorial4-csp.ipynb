Your code will be more readable if you can use Python's [list comprehensions](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions). We encode this problem exactly like we did in the local search tutorial. This means we use a python array of integers where each index represents the column of a queen on the board, and the number in each position of the array represents the row we place each queen. Thus, the solution to the example above would be encoded in the array ```[1, 3, 0, 2]```.\n",

        "- ```n_queens``` represents the number of queens of our problem\n",
        "- ```Q``` represents the array, in Z3 [Integer](https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/z3.z3.html#-Int) variables\n",
        "- ```val_c``` represents the constraints on the value of each index in our array, you will need an array of constraints, each of which containing a [disjunction](https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/z3.z3.html#-And) of the numeric range. For example, if you want a specific integer to be between $1$ and $10$ (exclusive), you would write the following constraint:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "number = Int('i')\n",
        "constraint = And(1 < number, number < 10)\n",
        "```\n",
        "- ```col_c``` represents the constraints that each value in our array must be [Distinct](https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/z3.z3.html#-Distinct)\n",
        "- ```diag_c``` represents the constraints that no other queen must be in the diagonal. This is the trickiest constraint to define, as you will require a [conditional expression](https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/z3.z3.html#-If). First, recall that each element in our array is a distinct column. If `i == j`, then `Q[i] == Q[j]`, and we don't need to constrain the values of `Q[i]` or `Q[j]`. Second, if `i != j`, then we need to ensure that `Q[i] - Q[j] != i - j` (going up the diagonal), and `Q[i] - Q[j] != j - i` (going down de diagonal), for all possible indexes of `Q`."
